<h2>Notes</h2>
Here is where you can put notes about the instructions. For instance:<br>
These instructions will only work on Revision A of the router. The revision B has it's own documentation in the routers directory. The differences are that the DHCP server dialog looks a bit diffrent. The rest of it will work on both Reveision A and B.
