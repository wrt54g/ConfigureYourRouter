## Accept insecure connection:
### Chrome
First, go to the page of the router and you might see this warning:
![Connection not private](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wrt54g/ConfiugreYourRouter/main/docs/images/shared/connection-not-private.png)<br>
There's nothing insecure about the page. It just means that the router doesn't have an official TLS/SSL certificate. But of course it isn't able to get an official certificate, because the IP is local.<br>
![Connection not private](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wrt54g/ConfiugreYourRouter/main/docs/images/shared/connection-not-private-advanced.png)<br>
You can safely proceed.
